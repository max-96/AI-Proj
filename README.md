# Tresette's AI

In our work we want to provide an AI capable of playing the Game of Tresette.
We are not aware of other attempts to develop skilled AIs for this game.

## Our Techniques

We plan to use determinization in order to apply common Full Information Game Algorithms
such as **Alpha-Beta** and **Monte Carlo Tree Search**.
At the moment, the determinization follows a common **Flat Monte Carlo** policy. 

Other than that, we want to use the **Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search** (Single Observer variant), that does not utilize determinization.
